- 👋 Hi, I’m @mArcinUci and I have been a physiotherapist for 18 years. I like to observe, analyze, predict the result, collect data, modify early assumptions and so on -> this has been my job so far. And since, after turning 40, I came to the conclusion that working in such a quantity in direct contact with the client is not for me, I decided to change something, hence here I am.
- 👀 I’m interested in how the human body works, and because most of the control systems are in the brain, which analyzes tens of thousands of information per second (eureka, this is why this unconscious part is useful to us) for many years I have been trying to figure out how it works. I believe ML can help us better understand many processes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and all around it: python basics, Object Orientated Programming, libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, also: basics of statistics, basics of ML, concepts and ideas behind it, and more down-to-earth things like: laptop support :), Git, Conda, Jupyer Notebook, Visual Studio Code, how to create proper CV and how to have better control over defence in console Fifa game 
- 💞️ I am looking for cooperation with someone who will provide me with conditions for development. At this point, I'm interested in ML and data science but I stay open and looking for someone who can guide me.
